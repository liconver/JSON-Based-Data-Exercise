# JSON-Based-Data-Exercise
My code answers the first two questions and performs the action asked in the third. At the bottom of the notebook are 3 print statements corresponding to each. 
The first output is a pandas series and I am wondering if I should have filtered it to exclude continents and only contain countries.  
The second output is a list.
The third output is a series from the final dataframe.
